    <h1>ID Selector</h1>

    <p>
        The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within
        the HTML document.
        The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by
        JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
        The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within
        curly braces {}.
    </p>
    <p> In the following example we have an "h1" element that points to the id name "myHeader". This "h1" element will
        be styled according to the #myHeader
        style definition in the head section:
    </p>

    <h1>Class Selector</h1>

    <p>
        The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.
    </p>
    <p> The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript
        to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

        In the following example we have three "div" elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of
        the three "div" elements will be styled equally according to the <strong>.city</strong> style definition in the
        head section:
