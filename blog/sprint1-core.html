        <h1>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</h1>
        <p>
            Last year i took on Netball and became a member in my church worship team. Not long into the season our team
            had
            to change competition days, which happened to be the same day I also had practice for church worship. I felt
            very conflicted to have had to choose between my spiritual and my physical well-being. Thankfully my coaches
            and
            worship leaders were all very understanding of my situation and we were able to come to an agreement of
            alternating each week.

        <h1>How your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h1>
        <p>
            My culture has ben heavily influenced by growing up in a big pacific family. Being a middle child I
            understand
            how is feels to be in the minority while also having a large understanding of authority, making me quiet
            sympathetic and understanding and always looking for a silver lining.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h1>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h1>
        <p>
            In relation to my statement above I see finding a silver lining or solution to any situation a great
            strength
            but can also be a limitation, at times i have disappointed myself because I don't always have the most
            useful,
            exciting or effective solution and often leads to discouragement. What I must work on is being acceptive of
            not
            always having the right answers and challenging myself to learning new and different strategies and or
            solutions.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h1>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with
            learning obstacles.</h1>
        <p>
            As mentioned above being a keen problem solver will definitely help me in my learning journey, coming out of
            college and straight into a working environment and into the I.T industry, being able to ask the right
            questions
            to guarantee the problem does not come up again is an aspect that will keep me learning and understanding
            more.
        </p>

        <h1>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there
            was
            resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your
            reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h1>
        <p>
            Back in college my science class had to do a group project that involved a lot of equipment, we had a week
            to
            complete both the research and report. Myself and 2 others knew how to set up the equipment and carry out
            the
            experiment whilst 1 other group member was not confident, after insisting that we show them how to set the
            equipment up they offered to complete the theory in return to sitting out the experimental side. As the week
            went on we same 3 would set up the equipment and record our results, when it came time to write up our
            report
            the 1 member who offered to write up our report debated they are not to do the paper alone because they have
            no
            knowledge of how the experiment was carried out therefore not knowing enough to ensure what was to be
            written
            about the experiment would be true or make sense. One of our group members was already agitated that this
            member
            would not participate in the first place and was now arguing with the member about fairness. Even though me
            and
            another member calmed the two down, the tension was still very much there and we ended up getting very
            little
            participation from the two that were arguing beforehand for the write up. In hindsight excusing an
            individual
            from one part of the project is as good as giving them a free pass, to avoid something like this happening
            again
            I think giving out equal responsibility and assigning clear roles at the start, while also checking in
            regularly
            about each roles status and progress will be beneficial.
