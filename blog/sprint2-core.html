    <h1>Long Term Goal</h1>
    <p>
        My long term carrier goal is to obtain 2 certifications, and work independently.
        I started working right out of college with no experience or knowledge about I.T so in my current role I am
        completing work through my superiors meaning before anything is published it is to be signed off on first. I
        would like to get to a point in my courier where I no longer have to be dependant on someone else.
    </p>

    <h1>Human Skills</h1>
    <p>
        I would like to be less critical on myself and work. Coming into the work environment straight out of College
        was a bit of a shock, and while I am at EDA I would like to develop a better understanding of do's and dont's
        for various events in work environment, I'd also like for my critical thinking to be more focused on positive
        reinforcement and construction more than negative points (ie.failing tasks).

    </p>

    <h1>Strengths and Limitations</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Strengths</strong>: I believe my strengths are being determined and showing leadership. Naturally im an
        introvert but throughout college I was given the opportunity to showcase my leadership through small projects
        such as poly group, and formal committee. As I developed, my peers around me noticed my strength in leadership
        and so it became a pattern, of not me volunteering myself, but them putting my name forward. From the support of
        my peers i began to recognise and develop my own voice in leadership. An example of my determination is shown
        through church commitments. Amongst my commitments with Netball and Work, i decided to take on another through
        church.As much as i enjoyed being in my church worship team, it came with a lot of obstacles. Having to balance
        this new commitment at church as well as net ball work, in itself was hard. It required a lot of determination,
        time management and sacrifice.


        <strong>Limitations</strong>: I've had trouble in the past with time management, focusing my energy on too many
        things at one time. I am learning to reserve my energy from things that i cannot control and focusing more on
        things that i can.

    <h1>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with
        learning obstacles.</h1>
    <p>
        I believe determination will help me in my learning journey. Being determined to allow myself to accept help
        when need, also voice my knowledge to help others, having the determination to want to learn more and push
        myself out of my comfort zone.
